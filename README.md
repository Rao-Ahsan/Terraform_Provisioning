# Terraform_Provisioning
Provisioning resources using Terraform

In this project, We will provision resources using Terraform. The plans to create a VPC, subnet, security group, internet gateway, NAT gateway, and route table. We will associate the route table and create an elastic IP. Additionally, We will deploy EC2 instances.

* Establish a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
* Subdivide the VPC into two subnets: one for public resources and another for private resources.
* Define a security group for your resources.
* Set up an Internet gateway.
* Configure a route table specific to the public subnet.
* Associate the route table with the public subnet.
* Create instances and establish connections.
* Generate an Elastic IP and link it to your web server.
* Deploy a database server instance beneath the web server.
* Establish a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.
* Create a route table tailored for the NAT gateway and associate it.
